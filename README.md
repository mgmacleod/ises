ISES (In Silico Evolution System) started out life as a final project for a 
graduate class in evolutionary computation (COMP 5206 at Carleton 
University). Originally, the idea was to 
implement the system described by 
[Jenkins and Stekel, 2010](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-010-9369-4), 
in which the  authors use GAs with biologically realistic mutation 
operators (such as, gene duplication and deletion) to evolve 
hierarchical gene regulatory networks. I'm now reviving it to expand and refine it in various ways.

I'll add more details as plans firm up.
